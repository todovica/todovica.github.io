It\n          could make your phone vulnerable to\n          malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s\n          security features and it could mean that the\n          Rock &amp; Friends app won’t work properly or at all.\n        </p> <p>\n          You should be aware that there are certain things that\n          Rock And Friends will not take responsibility for.\n          Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an\n          active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or\n          provided by your mobile network provider, but\n          Rock And Friends cannot take responsibility for the\n          app not working at full functionality if you don’t have\n          access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data\n          allowance left.\n        </p> <p /> <p>\n          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you\n          should remember that your terms of the agreement with your\n          mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you\n          may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data\n          for the duration of the connection while accessing the app,\n          or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re\n          accepting responsibility for any such charges, including\n          roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home\n          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data\n          roaming.
